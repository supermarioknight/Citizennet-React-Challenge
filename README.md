# Citizennet React Challenge

## Questions:
1. Load data (path: https://ac.aws.citizennet.com/assets/qspreviews/qs_interview_data.json)
2. Use ```assets/demo.png``` as an example, implement a generic function for reading any JSON file in that format, then display the top 12 brands based on audience_size. We always want to have 4 items in one row.
3. Add a hover state with a dark, semi-transparent overlay and display the ```id``` of ```source_items``` of the hovered brand.

The challenge is designed to be completed as a screening test. Please fork this repository and work from there. Push your project to GitHub and sent us a link.
